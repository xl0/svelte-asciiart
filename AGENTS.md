# State management

Maintain 2 important files in sync with the codebase:

- `CODE.md`: An in-depth summary of the current state of the codebase.
The file should contain high-level view of the code and only non-obvious implementation details. Don't overload it with small details.

- `PLAN.md`: High-level plan in plain English, followed by TODO with [x] boxes.
TODO items may be sections (## [x] Section) or paragraphs - don't make it rigid.
Write down commander's intent: what needs to be done matters; how is nice to have and subject to change.
As things are done, the plan gets compacted - paragraphs become list items, list items get merged and progressively discarded.

IMPORTANT: At the start of each conversation, always fully read `CODE.md`. You may read `PLAN.md` when relevant to the task.
Update the files as you go, keep the updates concise. Not a changelog - content reflects the current state, not history.
Don't put too much on one line, keep things readable.

# Guidelines

## Tone

- Be brief, be terse. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- The user is very smart, knowledgeable and intelligent. Treat him like it.
- Don't glaze the user. Correct his understanding if it's wrong. Push back on bad ideas.
- Keep the end of turn summaries very concise.
- No need to git diff at the end of the turn.

## Autonomy and persistence

- If the user asks for a plan, asks a question, brainstorming, or otherwise indicates conversation, reply or otherwise solve the users problem without editing the code. Otherwise, go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.

- Persist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.

- If you notice unexpected changes in the worktree or staging area that you did not make, continue with your task. Don't revert changes you did not make unless the user explicitly asks you to. There can be multiple agents or the user working in the same codebase concurrently.

## Code

- Use small edits where possible. Never use sed or other hacks to edit files. Re-read and retry using tools.

- The best changes are often the smallest correct changes.
- When you are weighing two correct approaches, prefer the more minimal one (less new names, helpers, tests, etc).
- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable.
- Avoid shallow abstractions. Avoid single-use abstractions. Deep abstractions with small interface preferred.

- No speculative try/catch with fall-backs. Only handle real errors, and default to a clear explicit fail, don't implement fallbacks unless asked.
- Never create legacy compatibility layers, unless asked specifically.
- When experimenting or debugging, don't gate the added code - we use git, we will roll it back after experiments.

- Document data structures and interfaces, not the code.
- Add succinct code comments that only if code is complex and not self-explanatory.

### Git

- Don't commit, unless the user explicitly instructed you. Our default workflow is work work work (often user in the loop), then test, often manually, then commit. The user may override this.  
- When you commit, it's possible that the worktree contains unrelated changes and untracked files. Don't blindly add files - only commit what's necessary.
- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.

# Strategic minimalism.

**Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it, say so in one line. (YAGNI)

**Bug fix = root cause, not symptom.** 

## Rules

- The best code is the code never written.
- Implement the smallest solution that actually works, simplest, shortest, most minimal.
- Question whether the task needs to exist at all (YAGNI), reach for the standard library before custom code, native platform features before dependencies, one line before fifty.
- No unrequested abstractions: no interface with one implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- No boilerplate, no scaffolding "for later", later can scaffold for itself.
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever.
- Fewest files possible. Shortest working diff wins — but only once you understand the problem. The smallest change in the wrong place isn't minimalism, it's a second bug.
- Complex request? Ship the simple version and question if the user wants more in the same response.
- Two stdlib options, same size? Take the one that's correct on edge cases. Write less code, but pick robust implementations.

- Read the actual flow before minimizing. Small wrong diffs are not minimalist, they are bugs.
- Search for and reuse existing helpers/patterns in the codebase before writing new ones.
- Never simplify away trust-boundary validation, security, accessibility, or data-loss prevention.
- If taking a deliberate shortcut, name the ceiling and upgrade trigger in one short comment (O(n²), global lock - optimize only if becomes a bottleneck).

Example: "Add a cache for these API responses."
Response: "`@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)` on the fetch function. Skipped custom cache class, add when lru_cache measurably falls short."

The shortest path to done is the right path.

## Lovely Docs

The current project will have documentation for many libraries inside ./lovely-docs/.
IMPORTANT: At the START of EVERY session, find all ./lovely-docs/\*/`LLM_MAP.md` and read them.
If documentation exists for a library you're about to use, always read the relevant sections before using a feature for the first time.

## TypeScript / Node / Svelte

- Always use bun/bunx, not npm
- You may install packages, double-check with the user if in doubt.
- If  project is using shadcn, prefer installing shadcn components over hand-rolled replacements.

### Running the checks

- Run `bun run check` after any changes that have chance of breaking things, but not after trivial changes.
- Run `agent-browser` after major changes only:

  > agent-browser console --clear && agent-browser errors --clear
  > agent-browser navigate ...
  > agent-browser console && agent-browser errors

- Unless you are debugging an active issue, just do a quick check - no screenshots, no or minimal navigation.

Note: we likely already have a dev server running on localhost:5173. If not, don't start the server, ask the user to do so.

### Web UI

- Keep it clean, err on the side of minimalism.
- Avoid adding custom colors, styles or fonts per element - use pre-defined (layout.css)
- Avoid hardcoded Tailwind values and magic numbers unless there is a concrete layout need.
